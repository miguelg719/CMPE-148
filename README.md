This program utilizes a server and a client file for each of the TCP and UDP protocols, taking an existing data file in the same directory as input.

The data file contains a series of numbers separated by whitespaces and newlines, which are read in by the server, and one by one the program calculates whether they are leap years or not.

I include my test cases in years.txt
